<!-- ## Sharjeel Baig
Hi there! I'm Sharjeel Baig, the Software Architect behind this project. Alongside architecture, I also implemented the deep-learning components, using Google’s OWL models for advanced image recognition. I handled the Supabase workflows as well, including data management, authentication, and storage. My work combines scalable architecture design with hands-on AI development to bring the entire system together. My expertise lies in designing scalable software architectures that drive efficiency and performance. I'm excited to share my work with you and look forward to connecting!

## Ahsaanullah Rauf
Hi! I'm Ahsaanullah Rauf, I was the one who brainstormed and came up with the idea of a security system that uses face recognition and intrusion detection, my contributions in this project is I was the Project Lead & Backend Developer for this project. I was responsible for developing the backend using Flask, including setting up the APIs, handling database interactions with the functions developed by Sharjeel, and ensuring secure authentication and data management with Supabase. My work focused on creating a robust and scalable backend infrastructure to support the application's needs.

## Sharjeel Baig

Sharjeel Baig is the Software Architect for this project, determined what tech stack to be used in it, including the choice of model to be used, how database should be implemented and how basic flow of whole project will be implemented. In addition to architecting the system, he implemented the deep-learning components using Google’s OWL V2 model for advanced object detection, utilizing face-comparer python module for face recognition. He also handled Supabase workflows, including data management, authentication, and storage. His work blends scalable architecture design with hands-on AI development to unify the system.
